// canonical request (see sigv4.canonicalQueryString), so once the signature is

// Multipart uploads are distinguished only by their query parameters — S3 spells
// them `uploads`, `uploadId` and `partNumber`, and the names are case-sensitive.
// Those branches are checked before the plain-object fallbacks they shadow, and

// does not match is not a multipart request and falls back to its plain-object
// classification, which requires the same permission.

// Reject (/blob/reject) is the "don't accept" inverse of `/blob/accept`: it
// retires a PARKED blob — allocated, never accepted, whether or not its
// bytes were ever received. A blob's lifecycle on a storage node ends in
// exactly one of `/blob/accept` (commit: aggregation, location claim,
// registration) or `/blob/reject` (drop: allocation released, bytes deleted).
//
// Served by storage nodes (subject = the provider DID, invoked by the
// upload service under its registration delegation, typically translating a
// client `/blob/abort`). The node drops the space's allocation and deletes
// any received bytes once no space holds an allocation or acceptance for
// the digest.
//
// A blob that THE INVOKING SPACE has accepted is refused with BlobAccepted —
// a space's accepted blobs are released via `/blob/remove`, never rejected.
// The guard is scoped to the invoking space, not the digest: another space's
// acceptance of the same bytes must not block the reject — the node simply
// drops this space's allocation and retains the bytes for the space that
// still claims them.
//
// Idempotent: rejecting an unknown or already-rejected blob succeeds.
// The receipt carries no payload (Unit).
